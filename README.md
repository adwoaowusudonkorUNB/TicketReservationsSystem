# TicketReservationsSystem

The purpose of our project is to implement software design patterns into an airline reservation system and to demonstrate that by implementing these design patterns into our software we can make the software more extendable, decrease coupling within the code and increase the flexibility and modularity of our software.
The software design patterns that we have implemented are- Flyweight, Bride Composite, Prototype, Singleton, Iterator and Observer
